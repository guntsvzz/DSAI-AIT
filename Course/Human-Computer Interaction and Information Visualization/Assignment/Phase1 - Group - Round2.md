# Phase 1: (Round 2!) Paper Reading

Good job on the first round!

This is the second round of your paper reading process. Please do the followings:

1. Gather up and discuss and finally decide on one very very focused topic to work on.     You need to decide now!   For example, AR/VR is a very broad topic.  You need something like "AR for text entry".   For another example,  "AI for health" is a very broad topic.  "AI for emotional health" is much better.   More specific, the better.   Make your life easier.  A topic is too broad when you search on the internet and you found 100+ papers. 

2. Similarly, each read 4 papers.   Now, students can read farther back (e.g., CHI 2015) since a very focused topic tends to have less paper.   If needed,  IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing journal, UIST, and IUI conferences are also quite good.

3. Most of your work in round 1 is quite decent.  Some possible room for improvement:
Try to avoid pure interview/questionnaire paper
Be very clear about the experimental design, e.g., IV, DV, and tasks, (because you later need to copy some of these in your work, so you need to be very clear....)
4. At the end of the PDF, please make one more table,  summarizing the following: 
    After reading all 20 papers, what are the gaps?  List 3-5.
    What are some possible hypotheses you think your team can investigate?   List 3-5.
    What is the state-of-the-art and baseline that people commonly compare? if they don't compare, how do they usually evaluate?
    What are the common IVs, DVs, tasks, metrics, etc? 
This summary will later help in your project framing.  So do it carefully, for your team, NOT FOR ME.

Submit the PDF.   One group one submission.

# Don't do 'difficult' topic.

1. Easy-clear problem
- text entry
- menu slection
- which finger have the highest
*Note* Clear IV and DV

2. Difficult
- Education -> many factors!
