- Research Question:We have proposed a gesture menu used in mobile phones - How does the newly proposed gesture menu compared to linear menu (baseline)?

- Independent variables: Input method (linear menu vs. gesture menu), Depth (1, 2, 3), Execution (guided, recall) (i.e., with instructions or no instruction)

- Dependent variables: Time and error rates

- Design the rest of the experiment, including the task and procedure, the participants, the order effects, number of trials and blocks, and last, calculate the total time of the experiment
