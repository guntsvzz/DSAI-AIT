# Phase 0: ACM CHI Video Previews (Submit as Individuals)
```
Please take note of 5 videos you really like, and discuss each of them writing (1) what its about, and (2) why you like it. It does not have to be comprehensive, just a few sentences suffice.  

Try to focus on something related to AI + emotion/cognition/health/elderly.

The key goal is to make you comfortable with what HCI is and to get some inspiration.
