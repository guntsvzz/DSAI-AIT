    "In this section we’ll take a look at how Transformer models can be used to condense long documents into summaries, a task known as text summarization. This is one of the most challenging NLP tasks as it requires a range of abilities, such as understanding long passages and generating coherent text that captures the main topics in a document. However, when done well, text summarization is a powerful tool that can speed up various business processes by relieving the burden of domain experts to read long documents in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there already exist various fine-tuned models for summarization on the Hugging Face Hub, almost all of these are only suitable for English documents. So, to add a twist in this section, we’ll train a bilingual model for English and Spanish.\n",

To get started, let’s download the English and Spanish subsets from the Hugging Face Hub:"

The unit arrived quickly, was well packaged and arrived intact (always a good sign). There are five wall mounts-- three on the top and two on the bottom. I wanted to mount it on the wall, so all I had to do was to remove the top two layers of plastic drawers, as well as the bottom corner drawers, place it when I wanted and mark it; I then used some of the new plastic screw in wall anchors (the 50 pound variety) and it easily mounted to the wall. Some have remarked that they wanted dividers for the drawers, and that they made those. Good idea. My application was that I needed something that I can see the contents at about eye level, so I wanted the fuller-sized drawers. I also like that these are the new plastic that doesn't get brittle and split like my older plastic drawers did. I like the all-plastic construction. It's heavy duty enough to hold metal parts, but being made of plastic it's not as heavy as a metal frame, so you can easily mount it to the wall and still load it up with heavy stuff, or light stuff. No problem there. For the money, you can't beat it. Best one of these I've bought to date-- and I've been using some version of these for over forty years.'\n"

    "\n",
    "If you think about it, text summarization is a similar sort of task to machine translation: we have a body of text like a review that we’d like to “translate” into a shorter version that captures the salient features of the input. Accordingly, most Transformer models for summarization adopt the encoder-decoder architecture, although there are some exceptions like the GPT family of models which can also be used for summarization in few-shot settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of Transformer models for summarization (and indeed most NLP tasks) are monolingual. This is great if your task is in a “high-resource” language like English or German, but less so for the thousands of other languages in use across the world. Fortunately, there is a class of multilingual Transformer models, like mT5 and mBART, that come to the rescue. These models are pretrained using language modeling, but with a twist: instead of training on a corpus of one language, they are trained jointly on texts in over 50 languages at once!\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll focus on mT5, an interesting architecture based on T5 that was pretrained in a text-to-text framework. In T5, every NLP task is formulated in terms of a prompt prefix like summarize: which conditions the model to adapt the generated text to the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "mT5 doesn’t use prefixes, but shares much of the versatility of T5 and has the advantage of being multilingual. Now that we’ve picked a model, let’s take a look at preparing our data for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next task is to tokenize and encode our reviews and their titles. As usual, we begin by loading the tokenizer associated with the pretrained model checkpoint. We’ll use mt5-small as our checkpoint so we can fine-tune the model in a reasonable amount of time:"

    "## 3. Metrics for text summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to most of the other tasks we’ve covered in this course, measuring the performance of text generation tasks like summarization or translation is not as straightforward. For example, given a review like “I loved reading the Hunger Games”, there are multiple valid summaries, like “I loved the Hunger Games” or “Hunger Games is a great read”. Clearly, applying some sort of exact match between the generated summary and the label is not a good solution — even humans would fare poorly under such a metric, because we all have our own writing style.\n",
    "\n",
    "For summarization, one of the most commonly used metrics is the ROUGE score (short for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). The basic idea behind this metric is to compare a generated summary against a set of reference summaries that are typically created by humans. To make this more precise, suppose we want to compare the following two summaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "    generated_summary = \"I absolutely loved reading the Hunger Games\"\n",
    "    reference_summary = \"I loved reading the Hunger Games\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "One way to compare them could be to count the number of overlapping words, which in this case would be 6. However, this is a bit crude, so instead ROUGE is based on computing the precision and recall scores for the overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For ROUGE, recall measures how much of the reference summary is captured by the generated one. If we are just comparing words, recall can be calculated according to the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Recall = Number of overlapping words / total number of words in reference summary\n",
    "\n",
    "For our simple example above, this formula gives a perfect recall of 6/6 = 1; i.e., all the words in the reference summary have been produced by the model. This may sound great, but imagine if our generated summary had been “I really really loved reading the Hunger Games all night”. This would also have perfect recall, but is arguably a worse summary since it is verbose. To deal with these scenarios we also compute the precision, which in the ROUGE context measures how much of the generated summary was relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Precision = Number of overlapping words / total number of words in generated summary\n",
    "    \n",
    "Applying this to our verbose summary gives a precision of 6/10 = 0.6, which is considerably worse than the precision of 6/7 = 0.86 obtained by our shorter one. In practice, both precision and recall are usually computed, and then the F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) is reported. We can do this easily in 🤗 Datasets by first installing the rouge_score package:"

    "Next, we need to define a data collator for our sequence-to-sequence task. Since mT5 is an encoder-decoder Transformer model, one subtlety with preparing our batches is that during decoding we need to shift the labels to the right by one. This is required to ensure that the decoder only sees the previous ground truth labels and not the current or future ones, which would be easy for the model to memorize. This is similar to how masked self-attention is applied to the inputs in a task like causal language modeling.\n",
