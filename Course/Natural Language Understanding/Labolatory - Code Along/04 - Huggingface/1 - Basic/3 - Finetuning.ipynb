    "We will use the MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus) dataset, introduced in a paper by William B. Dolan and Chris Brockett. The dataset consists of 5,801 pairs of sentences, with a label indicating if they are paraphrases or not (i.e., if both sentences mean the same thing). We’ve selected it for this chapter because it’s a small dataset, so it’s easy to experiment with training on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can load this dataset from the **Hub**.  The Hub doesn’t just contain models; it also has multiple datasets in lots of different languages. But for now, let’s focus on the MRPC dataset! This is one of the 10 datasets composing the GLUE benchmark, which is an academic benchmark that is used to measure the performance of ML models across 10 different text classification tasks.\n",
