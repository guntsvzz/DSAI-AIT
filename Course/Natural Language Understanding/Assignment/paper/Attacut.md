| Topic        | AttaCut: A Fast and Accurate Neural Thai Word Segmenter |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Question     | Other Thai segementation (Deepcut and Sertis) is slow and cannot use sub-word structues|
| Related Work | 1. Fast and accurate entity recognition with iterated dilated convolutions<br> 2. Multi-scale context aggregation by dilated convolutions|
| Solution     | CNN-based word segmentation model that utilizes character and syllable embeddings which reduces the number layers and computation time|
| Method       | | 
| Result       | |
| Conclusion   | With CNN-based word segmenter, it is 5.6Ã— faster than previous SOTA|
| Limitation   | suffering with idiosyncratic datasets such as poetry|
