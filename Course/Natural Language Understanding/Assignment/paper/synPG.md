| Topic        | Generating Syntactically Controlled Paraphrases without Using Annotated Parallel Pairs |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Question     | collecting annotated pair is not only expensive but also required experts to handle it|
| Related Work | Paraphrase generation - seq2seq model, back-translation, RL </br> Controlled generation - controlling the attributes & distentangled |
| Solution     | disentangle one sentence to two parts : semantic & syntatic, which keeping semantic part unchange unless modify its syntatic part|
| Method       | Using traditional Transformer whereas there 1. semantic encoder to contain source sentence as bag-of-word without ordering and learn</br> 2. syntatic encoder to embed the target constituency parse into contextualizaed embedding|
| Result       | 1. without syntatic, it generated by unsupervised baselines are similar to source </br> 2.without the disentanglement, seq2seq-syn alwasy copy the source sentence|
| Conclusion   | Training without annotated paraphrase pairs|
| Limitation   | It cannot diverse several word due to keeping semantic|
