| Topic        | Generating Syntactically Controlled Paraphrases without Using Annotated Parallel Pairs |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Question     | collecting annotated pair is not only expensive but also required experts to handle it|
| Related Work | Paraphrase generation </br> Controlled generation|
| Solution     | disentangle one sentence to two parts : semantic & syntatic, which keeping semantic part unchange unless modify its syntatic part|
| Method       | Using traditional Transformer whereas there semantic encoder to contain source sentence and syntatic encoder to embed the target parse|
| Result       | 1. without syntatic, it generated by unsupervised baselines are similar to source </br> 2.without the disentanglement, seq2seq-syn alwasy copy the source sentence|
| Conclusion   | Training without annotated paraphrase pairs|
| Limitation   | It cannot diverse several word due to keeping semantic|
