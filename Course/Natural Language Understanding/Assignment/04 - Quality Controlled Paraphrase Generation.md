| Question     | producing diversity is the main challenging to improver paraphase geneation|
| Related Work | 1.Supervised Approaches </br> 2.Unsupervised Approaches|
| Solution     | QCPG, a quality-guided controlled paraphrase generation model which present by 3-dimension vector of semantic similairity, and syntactic and lexical distances|
| Method       | 1.Quantifying Paraphrase Quality </br>- syntatic score normalized tree edit distance</br>- lexcical normalzed character-level minimum edit distnace btw bag of words</br> -studied the agreement between
the candidate metrics and human judgments </br> 2.
