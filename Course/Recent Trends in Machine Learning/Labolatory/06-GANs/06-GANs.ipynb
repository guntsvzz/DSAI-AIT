    "Generative models, however, model $P(x)$ or $P(x \\mid y)$.\n",
    "Generative models based on sampling take a random input and sometimes also a class $y$ such as a \"dog.\"\n",
    "From these inputs, a generative sampler will attempt to generate a set of features $x$ that are\n",
    "representative of the class \"dog.\" The random noise input ensures that we don't generate the same\n",

For example, in MNIST, number 1 can fool the discriminator, but number 3 cannot fool it. When the generator generates number 3, the discriminator will attack to the generator that it is fake but when the generator create number 1, the discriminator mostly say it is real. Thus, the generator will learn that \"OK, if I create '1', I will get reward\", then it will generate only number 1. That's is bias dataset creation called **Mode collapse**.\n",

One important difference from earlier versions is that you will **update the critic multiple times** every time you update the generator This helps prevent the generator from overpowering the critic.
