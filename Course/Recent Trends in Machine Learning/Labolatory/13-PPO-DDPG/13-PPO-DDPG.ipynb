    "\n",
    "The PPO algorithm was introduced by OpenAI in 2017 and quickly surpassed DQN in popularity.\n",
    "PPO collects a small batch of experiences of the agent interacting with the environment and\n",
    "uses that batch to update the policy. Experiences are only used once, immediately, making the\n",
    "method an on-policy method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key contribution of PPO is a regularization method ensuring that new updates to the policy do not change\n",
    "it too much, leading to lower variance at the cost of some bias, smooth training, without any catastrophic\n",
    "optimizations that lead to useless actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "(Why? Because PPO uses a stochastic policy (i.e. a conditional probability distribution of actions given states) and the policy's objective function is based on sampling from trajectories from a probability distribution that depends the current policy's probability distribution (i.e. you need to use the current policy to generate the trajectories). NOTE that this is true for any policy gradients approach using a stochastic policy, not just PPO.)\n",

    "\n",
    "(WHY? Because DDPG/TD3 use a deterministic policy and Silver, David, et al. \"Deterministic policy gradient algorithms.\" 2014. proved that the policy's objective function is an expectation value of state trajectories from the Markov Decision Process state transition function...but does not depend on the probability distribution induced by the policy, which after all is deterministic not stochastic.)"

You'll spend less wall-clock time training a PPO-like algorithm in a cheap environment.\n",

    "If you need to decide between DDPG and SAC, choose TD3. The performance of SAC and DDPG is nearly identical when you compare on the basis of whether or not a twin delayed update is used. SAC can be troublesome to get working, and the temperature parameter controls the stochasticity of your final policy -- effectively, it means your reward scheme can give you a policy that is too random to be useful, and picking a temperature parameter isn't necessarily straightforward. TD3 is almost the same as SAC, but noise injection is often easier to visualize and tune than setting the right temperature parameter."

During each trajectory roll-out, we save all the experience tuples (state, action, reward, next_state) and store them in a finite-sized cache — a “replay buffer.” Then, we sample random mini-batches of experience from the replay buffer when we update the value and policy networks.\n",

This fails to be the case when we optimize a sequential decision process in an on-policy way, because the data then would not be independent of each other.

    "One ability humans have is to learn from our mistakes and adjust next time to avoid making the same mistake. We can apply the same concept to our reinforcement learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this time, instead of concluding that the course of action you took was useless because you didn’t score a goal, what if you say that maybe it didn’t teach you how to score a goal, but it certainly taught you how NOT to shoot the puck. Or more precisely, what if you say it taught you how to shoot the puck slightly to the right side of the net? Now you can learn not only how to shoot towards the right, but you learn something new that might help you achieve the final goal every run. This is the idea behind Hindsight Experience Replay (HER).\n",
    "\n",
    "The HER procedure looks like this:\n",
    "1. Run your policy and store everything you observe (state and goal, action, reward, next state and goal) tuple into an experience buffer.\n",
    "2. Sample K goals from the states visited in the episode obtained at step 1, and for each goal store (state and sampled goal, action, reward with respect to the sampled goal, next state and sampled goal) tuple into the buffer.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 1–2 N times.\n",
    "4. Sample M number of experience tuples (batch) from the buffer and train the network with the said batch experience. (Do this B times)\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this help? By adding goal into the input space we are stating that there are multiple goals for our agent to observe. The new Q-function indicates how good taking each action is, given the current state, to achieving the current goal. And because we are sampling the new goals from the episode, the goals are now nodes that have been visited by our agent. So even if our agent fails to achieve the main goal in this episode, it has reached some states. By using those states as the new goal, now the agent can be trained with positive (or non negative) rewards."

    "In Reinforcement learning for discrete action spaces, exploration is done via probabilistically selecting a random action (such as epsilon-greedy or Boltzmann exploration). For continuous action spaces, exploration is done via adding noise to the action itself (there is also the parameter space noise but we will skip that for now). In the DDPG paper, the authors use Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process to add noise to the action output:\n",
