    "# RTML Lab 01: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll set up the Python and CUDA environment that we'll use for the rest of the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended environment for your work is Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will most likely have the best experience with Ubuntu by installing it natively on your development workstation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, an alternative path is to run Ubuntu side-by-side with Microsoft Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to our surveys, most DS&AI students are not yet ready to switch to Ubuntu for 100% of their work and would like a more gentle introduction\n",
    "to the use of Linux for software development. Therefore, in this tutorial, we assume you are running Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WSL\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to install WSL according to [Microsoft's WSL installation instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it's time to download a Linux distribution from the Windows store, choose \"Ubuntu 22.04.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenSSH feature in Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "If OpenSSH is not already enabled, go to the \"Manage Optional Features\" settings panel in Windows (\"Apps -> Optional features\" in Windows 11),\n",
    "select \"OpenSSH client\", and click \"Install\".\n",
    "\n",
    "More detail is available at [Microsoft's documentation page for OpenSSH installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse#installing-openssh-from-the-settings-ui-on-windows-server-2019-or-windows-10-1809).\n",
    "\n",
    "### VSCode\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code is a lightweight yet full featured cross platform IDE for software development that has recently caught up\n",
    "in terms of capabilities and popularity with other popular IDEs for Python such as PyCharm. It is somewhat easier to configure and use, also.\n",
    "Download and install VSCode from [the Visual Studio downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)."

    "## WSL Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point, let's set up Python under WSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab manuals for RTML, when you see commands beginning with '\\$' like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ ls\n",
    "    \n",
    "it means that you should run the command `ls` at your local WSL prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, you'll need to update Ubuntu's package lists, upgrade any that need upgrading, and then install Python 3 and the PIP package manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $ sudo apt-get update\n",
    "     $ sudo apt-get upgrade\n",
    "     $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you should be able to run Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python3\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    >>> print('Hello, world!')\n",
    "    Hello, world!\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "    \n",
    "(Here the `>>>` prompt means the Python interpreter prompt.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Python packages, use PIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install torch\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    $ python3\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    >>> import torch\n",
    "    >>> torch.__version__\n",
    "    '1.10.1'\n",
    "    \n",
    "To upgrade an existing package to the latest version, use the `-U` flag:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip3 install -U torch\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    $ python3\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    >>> import torch\n",
    "    >>> torch.__version__\n",
    "    '1.10.1+cu102'\n",
    "   \n",
    "That was easy, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "To work at a professional level with Python, you'll probably want to look at `virtualenv`, which allows you to\n",
    "maintain separate Python environments with all dependencies for each of your projects separately.\n",
    "If you like, take a look at\n",
    "[the Python docs on virtualenv](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/#lower-level-virtualenv) for more information.\n",
    "Note that in Ubuntu, the commands are `python3` and `pip3`, not `python` and `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, in RTML, we will do most of our work remotely with another technology,\n",
    "Docker, to isolate our projects, so we don't need to get into virtualenv right now."
