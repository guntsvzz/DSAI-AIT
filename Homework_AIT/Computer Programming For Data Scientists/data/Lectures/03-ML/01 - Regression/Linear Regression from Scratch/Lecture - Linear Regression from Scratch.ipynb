    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a supervised algorithm to make prediction based on continous y values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | Egg price  | Gold price    | Oil price   | GDP   |\n",
    "|---:|:-------------|:-----------|:------|:------|\n",
    "| 1 | 3  | 100       | 4   | 21   |\n",
    "| 2 | 4  | 500    | 7   | 43     |\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use egg price, gold price and oil price to predict GDP.  We called egg price, gold price, oil price **features** or $\\mathbf{X}$. We called what we want to predict **labels** or **targets** or $\\mathbf{y}$.  Each row is called **sample**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Notations and Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall use the following notations in our course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_j^{(i)}$ represents the i-th sample, and j-th feature. For example, $x_1^{(1)}$ denote egg price of the first sample (i.e., 100), $x_2^{(1)}$ for gold price of the first sample (i.e., 4), and $x_3^{(1)}$ for oil price of the first sample (i.e., 21).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bold captial $\\mathbf{X}$ denotes the whole **matrix** of features with $m$ rows of samples and $m$ columns of features.  The **shape** of $X$ is $(m, n)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bold lowercase $\\mathbf{x}$ denotes the single **vector** (i.e., column) of feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $y^{(i)}$ represents the **targets/labels** of the i-th sample, and $\\mathbf{y}$ refers to the whole **vector** of targets with **shape** of $(m, )$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis function** maps given input $\\mathbf{X}$ to predicted $\\mathbf{y}$.  We must **learn**/**train** this function.  To differentiate between actual and predicted $\\mathbf{y}$, we commonly called predicted $\\mathbf{y}$ as $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ (read as yhat).\n",
    "\n",
    "For linear regression, the hypothesis function (denoted as $h_{\\theta}(x)$ which means $h$ depends on $x$ parametized by $\\theta$ is defined as followed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "h_\\theta(x) &= \\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2x_2 + \\cdots + \\theta_nx_n \\tag{A}\\\\\n",

    "\\mathbf{h} &= \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\tag{D}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\theta$ are called **parameters** or **weights** or **coefficients** that parameterize the linear mappings from $\\mathbf{X}$ -> $\\mathbf{y}$.  Also, we commonly don't write equations in the (A) form.  We called (B) form as the **summation** form, (C) as the **vectorized** form, and (D) as the **matrix** form.  We like to write as (D) because it's easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting hypothesis function is called **model**.  The process is called **training** the model.  The latter process of testing the model on test set is called **inference**.\n",

    "### How to find the best $\\theta$ ==> Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we learn the best parameters $\\theta$?  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must define a **loss/objective function** (denoted as $J$) that measures, for a given $\\theta$, how close $h(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ are to the corresponding $\\mathbf{y}^{(i)}$.  :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^m(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to choose $\\theta$ so as to minimize $J(\\theta)$.  Such process is called **optimization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very successful optimization algorithm is called **gradient descent** algorithm, which is based on updating theta based on the **derivatives** (we also called **gradient**).   **Why gradient descent works?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This figure illustrates why:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=\"400\" src = \"figures/gradient.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with some random $\\theta$, and repeatedly performs the update:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha * \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "This update is simultaneously performed for all values of $j=0, 1, \\cdots, n$ (if you forget, $j$ here refers to each feature :-).  Here, $\\alpha$ is called the **learning rate**, ranging from 0 to 1.  Commonly, we tried 0.001 as default, and this value must be manually handpicked.  Any parameters such as learning rate are called **hyperparameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement this algorithm, we have to find the **partial derivative of the loss function in respect to each $\\theta_j$**.  Let's try the partial derivative of our loss function in respect to $\\theta_j$.  Also, let's first work it out for only one training example first as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta_j} &= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\frac{1}{2}(h_\\theta(x) - y)^2 \\\\\n",
    "&= 2 * \\frac{1}{2} (h_\\theta(x) - y) * \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} (h_\\theta(x) - y) \\\\\n",
    "&= 2 * \\frac{1}{2} (h_\\theta(x) - y) * \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_j} \\big(\\sum_{i=0}^n \\theta_ix_i - y\\big) \\\\\n",
    "&= (h_\\theta(x) - y)x_j \\\\\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**==>Note: If you don't understand this, don't worry.  Just know why derivatives can help you find optimum**\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- This rule has several properties that seem natural and intuitive. For instance, the magnitude of the update is proportional to the **error** term $h_\\theta(x) - y$; thus, for instance, if we are encountering a training example on which our prediction nearly matches the actual value of $y^{(i)}$, then we find that there is little need to change the parameters; in contrast, a larger change to the parameters will be made if our prediction has a large error (i.e., if it is very far from $y^{(i)}$).\n",
    " -->\n",
    "To modify the update rule for whole training example, we revise the update rule to include the summation as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha * \\sum_{i=1}^m(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} \\tag{for every $j$}$$  or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta = \\theta - \\alpha * \\mathbf{X}^\\top (\\mathbf{h} - \\mathbf{y})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this gradient descent calculates gradient using every example in the entire training set, we called this as **batch gradient descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, performing batch gradient descent can be slow, thus we can use **stochastic gradient descent** which refers to looking at only one training example, where we can pick with or without replacement.  Here, **without replacement** refers to the process in which no same sample is used in the same **epoch**.  Here epoch means one  iteration which the whole training set is being exhausted.  Thus, in without replacement, we simply loop from $i =1$ to $m$ for one epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha * ((h_\\theta(x)^{(i)}-y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}) \\tag{for every $j$}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although **stochastic gradient descent** may be faster, it rarely converges to the optimum given its randomness.  A middle ground is **mini-batch gradient descent** which can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_j := \\theta_j - \\alpha * \\sum_{i=start}^{batchsize}(h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} \\tag{for every $j$}$$\n",
