# Autistic Application using Dependency Parsing 
This project aims to create Graphical User Interface(GUI) which is support special kids with autism and other non-verbal communicators and particularly related to Data structures and algorithms by using Dependency Parsing which is a part of Speech and Language Processing. Then comparing efficiency of each algorithm.

## Dependencies :
