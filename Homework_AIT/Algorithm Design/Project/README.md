    - https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
- Spacy Library
    - https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101
    - en_web_core_sm model

## Components

- main.py
    - Graphical User Interface using Tkinter
- algorithm.py
    1. Transition-Based Dependency Parsing
        - Stack : Enqueue and Dequeue *Complete*
        - Stack and Buffer
            - Projective using Arc-Standard *Complete*
            - Nonjective using Arc-Eager *Future*
        - Dependency Tree
            - BST *Complete*
            - DFS *Complete*
    2. Graph-Based Dependency Parsing
        - Chu-Liu-Edmonds : Maximum Spanning Tree

## Future Work
